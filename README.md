# Pacini-typing

---

The Pacini project is a software application which can be used to determine genetic variants in bacteria. These variants are:

1. Presence or absence of certain genes
2. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)

> Based on these variants, the application can estimate the pathogenicity of the given bacteria/organism. The pathongenicity patterns are defined in a set of rules in a configuration file.
